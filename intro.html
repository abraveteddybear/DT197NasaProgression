              <p class="text-white mb-4"> 
                  This project focuses on the image of NASA, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, 
                  and its roles throughout time since its conception in 1958 by President Eisenhower. It goes without saying that the cultural atmosphere since the
                  late fifties and early sixties has drastically changed. NASA, being such a pivotal and active organization publically and behind the scenes, has been 
                  a symbol of America’s technological achievement for decades. Through this project, we have gained a more cohesive understanding on how the organization 
                  has changed throughout the decades and also has allowed us to see trends within NASA itself, blocking it into 3 main eras we will 
                  be focusing on. 
              </p>     
                  <ul type="I" class="text-white mb-4">
                      <li><a href="#ERA1">(1960s)</a> NASA began as a leading figurehead in the fight against the Red Tide, attempting to keep American superiority in the technological, 
                          but non-militant, fields.
                      </li> 
                      <li> <a href="#ERA2">(1970s - 1980s)</a> After the moon landing occurred, the organization reevaluated it’s main mission and changed what its future would be. 
                      </li>
                      <li><a href="#ERA3">(1990s - Present Day)</a> The modern era of NASA sees the administration striving to be a global beacon of technological advancement and 
                          achievement which goes beyond the boundaries of nations and borders of our Earth through coordination and cooperation. 
                          We have compiled our own data sets of mission statements, reports, legislation, and timelines from open government information 
                          such as from the NASA archives and presidential archives. 
                      </li>
                    </ul>
              <p class="text-white mb-4">      
                  
                  There is a lack of commentary to find on the cultural image of NASA throughout time. Although, there is plenty to extrapolate from texts 
                  throughout the years about NASA. Most of the controversy surrounding NASA is about funding and what they should be focusing on currently. 
                  Much of this idea has not been explored yet, much of the information surrounding NASA is quantitative with not very much qualitative besides 
                  more recent twenty first century articles written to criticize NASA, this being more opinion based rather than exploratory. This is a 
                  large reasoning for the project to explore the significance of the organization. 
                <br><br>
                  What this work aims to accomplish is establishing a view of NASA throughout its lifetime connecting the quantitative data, which is always 
                  brought up when discussing this topic, with the qualitative data which is absent from many accounts on NASA. We want to find out how NASA appeared
                  to the public so that we can help others, as well as ourselves, understand what NASA is or has been to show how it can be compared or used to view
                  the United States. We are entering another generation where NASA will be a leading figurehead in the future of not only Americans but people globally,
                  therefore observing the past we can learn a lot about our future. NASA helped usher in a new post Cold War age setting the United States as the 
                  technological and sole superpower of the world, now we may see them play another pivotal role in the future of all.
