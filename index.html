          <p class="text-white-50">   
		This project focuses on the image of NASA, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, and its roles throughout time since its conception in 1958 		by President Eisenhower. It goes without saying that the cultural atmosphere since the late fifties and early sixties has drastically changed. NASA, 			being such a pivotal and active organization publically and behind the scenes, has been a symbol of America’s technological achievement for decades. 			Through this project, we have gained a more cohesive understanding on how the organization has changed throughout the decades and also has allowed us to 			see trends within NASA itself, blocking it into 3 main eras we will be focusing on. (1) (1960s) NASA began as a leading figurehead in the fight against 		the Red Tide, attempting to keep American superiority in the technological, but non-militant, fields. (2) (1970s,1980s) After the moon landing occurred, 			the organization reevaluated it’s main mission and changed what its future would be. (3) (1990s Present Day) The modern era of NASA sees the 			administration striving to be a global beacon of technological advancement and achievement which goes beyond the boundaries of nations and borders of 			our Earth through coordination and cooperation. We have compiled our own data sets of mission statements, reports, legislation, and timelines from open 		government information such as from the NASA archives and presidential archives. <!--</p> -->

	<!-- <p class="text-white-50"> -->	
		There is a lack of commentary to find on the cultural image of NASA throughout time. Although, there is plenty to extrapolate from texts throughout the 		years about NASA. Most of the controversy surrounding NASA is about funding and what they should be focusing on currently. Much of this idea has not 			been explored yet, much of the information surrounding NASA is quantitative with not very much qualitative besides more recent twenty first century 			articles written to criticize NASA, this being more opinion based rather than exploratory. This is a large reasoning for the project to explore the 			significance of the organization.
		</br></br>

	<p class="text-white-50"> -->	
		What this work aims to accomplish is establishing a view of NASA throughout its lifetime connecting the quantitative data, which is always brought up 			when discussing this topic, with the qualitative data which is absent from many accounts on NASA. We want to find out how NASA appeared to the public so 			that we can help others, as well as ourselves, understand what NASA is or has been to show how it can be compared or used to view the United States. We 		are entering another generation where NASA will be a leading figurehead in the future of not only Americans but people globally, therefore observing the 			past we can learn a lot about our future. NASA helped usher in a new post Cold War age setting the United States as the technological and sole 			superpower of the world, now we may see them play another pivotal role in the future of all.
