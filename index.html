              This project focuses on the image of NASA, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, 
              and its roles throughout time since its conception in 1958 by President Eisenhower. It goes without saying that the cultural atmosphere since the
               late fifties and early sixties has drastically changed. NASA, being such a pivotal and active organization publically and behind the scenes, has been 
               a symbol of America’s technological achievement for decades. Through this project, we have gained a more cohesive understanding on how the organization 
               has changed throughout the decades and also has allowed us to see trends within NASA itself, blocking it into 3 main eras we will 
               be focusing on. 
          </p>     
               <ul type="I" class="text-white mb-4">
                  <li><a class="nav-link js-scroll-trigger" href="#ERA1">(1959 - 1975)</a> NASA began as a leading figurehead in the fight against the Red Tide, attempting to keep American superiority in the technological, 
                      but non-militant, fields.
                  </li> 
                  <li> <a class="nav-link js-scroll-trigger" href="#ERA2">(1975 - 1980s)</a> After the moon landing occurred, the organization reevaluated it’s main mission and changed what its future would be. 
                  </li>
                  <li><a class="nav-link js-scroll-trigger" href="#ERA3">(1990s - Present Day)</a> The modern era of NASA sees the administration striving to be a global beacon of technological advancement and 
                      achievement which goes beyond the boundaries of nations and borders of our Earth through coordination and cooperation. 
                      We have compiled our own data sets of mission statements, reports, legislation, and timelines from open government information 
                      such as from the NASA archives and presidential archives. 
                  </li>

          <p class="text-white mb-4">      
              
              There is a lack of commentary to find on the cultural image of NASA throughout time. Although, there is plenty to extrapolate from texts 
              throughout the years about NASA. Most of the controversy surrounding NASA is about funding and what they should be focusing on currently. 
              Much of this idea has not been explored yet, much of the information surrounding NASA is quantitative with not very much qualitative besides 
              more recent twenty first century articles written to criticize NASA, this being more opinion based rather than exploratory. This is a 
              large reasoning for the project to explore the significance of the organization. 
            <br><br>
              What this work aims to accomplish is establishing a view of NASA throughout its lifetime connecting the quantitative data, which is always 
              brought up when discussing this topic, with the qualitative data which is absent from many accounts on NASA. We want to find out how NASA appeared
              to the public so that we can help others, as well as ourselves, understand what NASA is or has been to show how it can be compared or used to view
              the United States. We are entering another generation where NASA will be a leading figurehead in the future of not only Americans but people globally,
              therefore observing the past we can learn a lot about our future. NASA helped usher in a new post Cold War age setting the United States as the 
              technological and sole superpower of the world, now we may see them play another pivotal role in the future of all.

        <p class="left">
            In 1958 the legislation which would see to the creation of NASA was passed through Congress just over a decade after the Cold War began. 
            President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in the midst of a cold war with the USSR or Soviet Union, created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
            to keep the Arms Race and the Space Race as separated as possible. The idea at the time was that a military led race to space would only escalate 
            the cold war further.
        
        </p>
        <p class="left">America was the symbol for western technology and power, NASA as an extension was the, nonmilitary, spearhead for research with the US as 
          its driving force as it plunged into space. The world was a melting pot for all sorts of propaganda and America was not saved from that, the effects 
          NASA’s progress had on American moral can not be understated. There is no doubt that Sputnik I was a huge hit to take but with the launch of Explorer 
          1 by the Americans it put the game on a more equal playing field. 
        </p>  
        <p class="left">The next huge milestone was the first man to space, the Soviets were the first to do 
          it but only a few days after NASA sent astronaut Alan Shepard into space for just over nine days in May 1961, NASA caught up to the Soviets in a few 
          days when it took the military three months between Sputnik and Explorer. This shows the change NASA had to the Space Race. America ended the decade 
          in second place but started the 60’s in a tie with the stakes getting higher and the goals reaching new heights. May 1961, President John F. Kennedy 
          announces the Apollo Project which plans to put an American man on the Moon due to the urgent needs of the nation. 
        </p>  
        <p class="left">The Gemini missions pave the way for 
          the Apollo missions with the first EVA or spacewalk by an American in June 1965 by Edward H. White II. This paired with the monumental landing on the 
          Moon in July 1969 and subsequent moon landings afterwards by American crews launched America into the lead in the Space Race which was now very much in 
          the Western Bloc’s favor. NASA’s creation and involvement shifted the Space Race into the Americans’ favor, NASA was the symbol of American technology 
          and with every achievement the power of the Eastern Bloc faded. Those wanting to learn about the technological might of the United States need look no 
          further than the, then mind bending, goals they had managed to reach.
        </p>
        <p class="leftLast">After this American victory in space there was a cooling of heads around the world. The DoomsDay clock moved further from midnight 
          and the collaboration between the Soviet space program and NASA began. The first cooperation was the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in July 1975 which was 
          used to test the compatibility of working in space and the two docking systems which went on to be a success and marked the end of the Space Race with 
          America the victor. It is apparent that NASA’s cooperation with the Soviet space program is the demonstration of lowered tensions which would be a direct 
          translation from America’s view and how those inside and outside could view the state of the nation and the Cold War which would go on to official be 
          called to an end by the dissolving of the Soviet Union in 1991.

        <p class="left">After the Apollo missions (1961 - 1972) ended, NASA experienced a significant dip in funding from the United States government. A permanent US space
        station was planned starting in 1969 but due to the loss of funding, the project transformed into what we now know as the Skylab project (shown left). <br>
        </p>
        <p class="left"><br>The Skylab project is the United State’s first and last independently built space station and was currently at its height in 1973 to 1974, occupying
        and housing 3 successive crews for a total of 171 days. Unfortunately, the Space Shuttle intended to be used to re-boost Skylab was not prepared 
        in time to save the station. Skylab burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere in 1979 over the Indian Ocean.

        <p class="left">
            Before this, bringing in 1972, Another project was also beginning. President Richard M, Nixon and Soviat Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an 
            agreement on May 24th, 1972. With this agreement, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project began. It marked the first joint mission between the United 
            States and Soviat space flight program and was a resounding symbol of the attempts by both superpowers to lessen the tensions between the two. 
            In July 1975, the two nations watched as 5 men (the american crew shown right) paved the way for future international partnerships by docking two seperate spacecraft. 
            This was the last Apollo mission flown and officially marked the end of the space race between the Soviets and the US, making way for a more 
            cooperative future.

        <p class="left">
            In this time, Dr. James C Fletcher (seen first left, standing admist the crew of Star Trek's Enterprise) was the director of NASA at the time. Analyzing his speeches lead to a surprising 
            result that we were not expecting. Fletcher was known for his advocacy of the Space Shuttle program throughout his tenure as Directory, worked to 
            complete the Viking Program (a program who's intent was to send landers to mars), oversaw the Skylab mission (as mentioned above), approved the Voyager Space 
            Probes and the Apollo-Soyuz project. He left NASA in 1977 but still was an active advisor to national leaders at the time and played a large role in 
            planning the future of space policy after the Challenger’s last fatal flight. 
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            Knowing this sheds light on how he spoke to Congress about NASA during his time as Director. When analyzing his speeches, we can see that his 
            opinions about NASA’s future was different than those of previous directors. A small sideword; We chose to focus on speeches Directors made to 
            congress on budgets (as the directors are advocating for funds for NASA) and Speeches made directly about NASA’s future and how the Administration 
            was moving forward. Using voyant, we were able to pull the most common words; Space, Program, Nasa, Mars, International, 
            technology, cooperation.

            It’s interesting to see how often Fletcher advocated for NASA to become more cooperative with other nations in 
            his speeches (listed below). Over all, Fletcher advocated for more communication with other superpowers and the programs he ushered and encouraged 
            into existence show it, especially the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Through him, we are better able to see NASA transitioning to a more internationally
            centered entity, taking its first real steps away from the more military driven mission of space expansion in the past.

            Dr Robert A. Frosch took over as Director of NASA after Fletcher stepped down in 1977, serving in the Carter administration. During his tenure at 
            NASA, he oversaw and implemented Fletcher’s vision of the Space Shuttle program, making it his own. Being a man of science, Dr Frosch was someone 
            who grew NASA in a more research driven approach, allowing for missions, space shuttle slights, technology and data to take precedence. He oversaw 
            several key projects during his tenure at Nasa.

            The first space shuttle orbiter, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/40-years-ago-space-shuttle-enterprise-rolls-to-the-pad">Enterprise (OV101)</a>, 
            named of course after the Enterprise from the popular tv series Star Trek, was first flown on 
            top of a Boeing 747 ferrying aircraft February 17, 1977. The successful flight proved that the Shuttle could fly attached to the 747. While it was 
            never destined for space travel, as it was constructed without engines or functional heat shielding, it marked an important achievement for the NASA 
            community. The Enterprise paved the way for future shuttles to be safer, allowing for NASA to run series of tests on it, including but not limited to 
            Approach and Landing tests (ALT) and the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test (MGVT), so that they could be better able to design future shuttles.

            Also in 1977 (August 20th, 1977 and September 5th, 1977 to be exact), NASA launched 
            <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/">Voyager 1 and 2</a>, missions that are still continuing to 
            this day. Due to the budget cuts of the time, Voyager 1, which has been initially planned as “Mariner 11”, was scaled back to simply have a flyby
            of both Jupiter and Saturn. However, on November 12th, 1980, Voyager 1 would become the third of five artificial objects to achieve escape velocity 
            required to leave the solar system. Although Voyager 2 was launched before Voyager 1, it took a longer path to Jupiter and Saturn, allowing it to 
            have encounters with both Uranus and Neptune, marking it as the only spacecraft who had visited both of the ice planets.  It later became the fifth 
            artificial object to achieve escape velocity, leaving our solar system after Voyager 1. Both crafts still communicate with NASA and are still 
            collecting data, continuing their voyage of the stars.

            And while he wasn’t in office at the time, Dr Frosch also encouraged the 
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/columbia_info.html">Space Shuttle Columbia mission</a> (April 12th, 1981). 
            The heaviest of NASA's orbiters, 
            Columbia weighed too much and lacked the necessary equipment to assist with assembly of the International Space Station. Despite its limitations, the 
            orbiter's legacy is one of groundbreaking scientific research and notable "firsts" in space flight. It marked a notable change in the Space Shuttle program 
            and was useful in teaching many firsts to NASA.

            <a href=”https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/seasat/”>Seasat-A</a> (26 Jun. 1978), one of the earliest Earth-observing satellites desgined to test various 
            oceanographic sensors and gain a better understanding of Earth’s seas. It opperated for a total of 105 days, measuring sea-surface winds and temperatures, 
            wave heights, atmospheric liquid water content, sea ice features and ocean topography before a short circuit in the spacecraft;s electrical system ended the 
            mission.

        <p class="left">
            <a href=”https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/nimbus-7”>Nimbus 7</a> (24 Oct. 1978), research-and-development satellite was launched and served as a stabilized, 
            earth-oriented platform for the testing of advanced systems used to sense and collect data in the pollution, oceanographic, and meteorological disciplines.

            The <a href=”https://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/pvo.html”> Pioneer Venus Orbiter</a> (May 20th, 1978), was a mission whose primary objective was 
            to investigate the solar wind in the Venusian environment, map Venus' surface through a radar imaging system, and study the characteristics of the upper 
            atmosphere and ionosphere. The mission lasted a total of 14 years, the last transmission from the orbiter occuring on October 8th, 1992.

            The <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/solarmax.html">Solar Maximum Mission</a> (Febuary 14th, 1980), was primarily made to study 
            the Sun during the high part of the solar cycle. The mission did hit a snag when the satellite malfunctioned and cut the original mission short. SMM was 
            recovered by the space shuttle Challenger in April of 1984 and serviced while it was in orbit. It lived a productive life until it’s orbit decayed and the 
            SMM burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere in December 1989.

          By looking at the analysis of his speeches, we see that the words space (168), program (119), technology (90), Systems (74), data (73), flight (56), 
          test (46),  appear with the greatest frequency from his selected speeches to congress and those speeches concerning NASA’s future, allowing us to 
          confirm that he was more invested in the research aspect of what NASA had to offer at the time. Dr. Frosch took the lead from Fletcher and built 
          NASA in with research in mind and the future of Space ever present in the space shuttle program, further departing from what NASA had originally 
          been intended to be. Rather than limit themselves  
          He stepped down from NASA as the Presidential Administration changed, going on to conduct further research throughout his lifetime.

      <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: none;"> <u>James M Beggs; 1981-1985</u></h4>
        <p class="left">
            James M Beggs also has a very similar focus on the technology and research aspect of NASA, however he oversaw a large portion of the Space 
            Shuttle program. When analysing his speeches, you can see he had a focus on shuttle, research, development, programs , launch and flight. 
            During Begg’s tenure, the Space Shuttle Columbia experienced its first flight, and in 1982, the space shuttle helped to deploy two commercial 
            communications satellites. The Space Shuttle Challenger also flew in April of 1983, launching three new satellites and the first American woman 
            astronaut, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/sally-ride-first-american-woman-in-space">Dr Sally K Ride</a> 
            made it to space aboard the shuttle. Another groundbreaking achievement occurred the challenger again as in August 1983, 
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/workinginspace/bluford_1st_african_amer.html">Dr Guion S Bluford </a>
            became the first African American astronaut. 
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            In 1984, President Ronald Reagan announced that the United States would be finding 
            and setting out to build a Space Station within a decade. The American people were becoming more and more used to the idea of Space travel and 
            during Begg’s time, 23 missions with the 4 space shuttles, Challenger, Discovery, Colombia, Atlantis, were successfully completed. In this part of 
            NASA’s history, we see a slightly upward trend with the budget even though NASA itself was becoming a more science and technology based entity, which 
            is an interesting shift from the defunding we saw after the completion of the Apollo program. While the budget did not and probably never will achieve 
            the same heights that it did during the cold war, this is still a notable change. The American people also seemed to have shifted their opinions 
            about NASA and what it represented. As the space shuttle program continued, it became a normalized part of American culture, far removed from the 
            military operations it had once been.

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: none;"> <u>Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster</u></h4>
        <p class="left">
            Ronald Regan and NASA held a competition, Teacher in Space, as a means to inspire students, honor teachers and spur an interest in STEM pursuits 
            in 1984. Unfortunately, it was destined not to continue. On January 8th 1986, the 
            <a ref="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_gallery_2437.html">Space Shuttle Challenger</a>was destroyed and its crew of seven-Francis 
            R. (Dick) Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Judith A. Resnik, Ronald E. McNair, Ellison S. Onizuka, Gregory B. Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe-was killed, 
            during its launch from the Kennedy Space Center about 11:40 a.m. The crewmembers of the Challenger represented a cross-section of the American 
            population in terms of race, gender, geography, background, and religion. The explosion became one of the most significant events of the 1980s, 
            as millions around the world saw the accident on television and empathized with any one of the seven crew members killed. William R Graham, the 
            NASA administrator at the time, having served for less than a year, stepped down as Dr James C. Fletcher returned to NASA to once again become 
            NASA’s director. Under his leadership, NASA began implementing the next steps the Agency would take moving forward. The loss of life on the 
            Challenger staggered the American people, but none more so than Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who had been selected to accompany the crew. NASA 
            had had accidents prior to this one but this crash was the first time a civilian had been killed at NASA. Due to this, Fletcher invested heavily in 
            restructuring the organization's management system, making it safer and more efficient. He also oversaw a complete reworking of the shuttle’s 
            components itself. The Space Shuttle Program would continue but only after intensive restructuring.
