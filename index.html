          <p class="text-white mb-4"> 
              This project focuses on the image of NASA, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, 
              and its roles throughout time since its conception in 1958 by President Eisenhower. It goes without saying that the cultural atmosphere since the
               late fifties and early sixties has drastically changed. NASA, being such a pivotal and active organization publically and behind the scenes, has been 
               a symbol of America’s technological achievement for decades. Through this project, we have gained a more cohesive understanding on how the organization 
               has changed throughout the decades and also has allowed us to see trends within NASA itself, blocking it into 3 main eras we will 
               be focusing on. 
          </p>     
               <ul type="I" class="text-white mb-4">
                  <li><a href="#ERA1">(1960s)</a> NASA began as a leading figurehead in the fight against the Red Tide, attempting to keep American superiority in the technological, 
                      but non-militant, fields.
                  </li> 
                  <li> <a href="#ERA2">(1970s - 1980s)</a> After the moon landing occurred, the organization reevaluated it’s main mission and changed what its future would be. 
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="#ERA3">(1990s - Present Day)</a> The modern era of NASA sees the administration striving to be a global beacon of technological advancement and 
                      achievement which goes beyond the boundaries of nations and borders of our Earth through coordination and cooperation. 
                      We have compiled our own data sets of mission statements, reports, legislation, and timelines from open government information 
                      such as from the NASA archives and presidential archives. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
          <p class="text-white mb-4">      
              
              There is a lack of commentary to find on the cultural image of NASA throughout time. Although, there is plenty to extrapolate from texts 
              throughout the years about NASA. Most of the controversy surrounding NASA is about funding and what they should be focusing on currently. 
              Much of this idea has not been explored yet, much of the information surrounding NASA is quantitative with not very much qualitative besides 
              more recent twenty first century articles written to criticize NASA, this being more opinion based rather than exploratory. This is a 
              large reasoning for the project to explore the significance of the organization. 
            <br><br>
              What this work aims to accomplish is establishing a view of NASA throughout its lifetime connecting the quantitative data, which is always 
              brought up when discussing this topic, with the qualitative data which is absent from many accounts on NASA. We want to find out how NASA appeared
              to the public so that we can help others, as well as ourselves, understand what NASA is or has been to show how it can be compared or used to view
              the United States. We are entering another generation where NASA will be a leading figurehead in the future of not only Americans but people globally,
              therefore observing the past we can learn a lot about our future. NASA helped usher in a new post Cold War age setting the United States as the 
              technological and sole superpower of the world, now we may see them play another pivotal role in the future of all.

          In 1958 the legislation which would see to the creation of NASA was passed through Congress just over a decade after the Cold War began. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in the midst of a cold war with the USSR or Soviet Union, created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to keep the Arms Race and the Space Race as separated as possible. The idea at the time was that a military led race to space would only escalate the cold war further.

      <p class="text-black-65 mb-0"> <iframe style='width: 1000px; height: 630px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?view=Cirrus&corpus=1da3d0889e98d6c315c7ccc5a01cc124'></iframe> </p>
      <p>America was the symbol for western technology and power, NASA as an extension was the, nonmilitary, spearhead for research with the US as its driving force as it plunged into space. The world was a melting pot for all sorts of propaganda and America was not saved from that, the effects NASA’s progress had on American moral can not be understated. There is no doubt that Sputnik I was a huge hit to take but with the launch of Explorer 1 by the Americans it put the game on a more equal playing field. The next huge milestone was the first man to space, the Soviets were the first to do it but only a few days after NASA sent astronaut Alan Shepard into space for just over nine days in May 1961, NASA caught up to the Soviets in a few days when it took the military three months between Sputnik and Explorer. This shows the change NASA had to the Space Race. America ended the decade in second place but started the 60’s in a tie with the stakes getting higher and the goals reaching new heights. May 1961, President John F. Kennedy announces the Apollo Project which plans to put an American man on the Moon due to the urgent needs of the nation. The Gemini missions pave the way for the Apollo missions with the first EVA or spacewalk by an American in June 1965 by Edward H. White II. This paired with the monumental landing on the Moon in July 1969 and subsequent moon landings afterwards by American crews launched America into the lead in the Space Race which was now very much in the Western Bloc’s favor. NASA’s creation and involvement shifted the Space Race into the Americans’ favor, NASA was the symbol of American technology and with every achievement the power of the Eastern Bloc faded. Those wanting to learn about the technological might of the United States need look no further than the, then mind bending, goals they had managed to reach.
        </p>
      <p>After this American victory in space there was a cooling of heads around the world. The DoomsDay clock moved further from midnight and the collaboration between the Soviet space program and NASA began. The first cooperation was the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in July 1975 which was used to test the compatibility of working in space and the two docking systems which went on to be a success and marked the end of the Space Race with America the victor. It is apparent that NASA’s cooperation with the Soviet space program is the demonstration of lowered tensions which would be a direct translation from America’s view and how those inside and outside could view the state of the nation and the Cold War which would go on to official be called to an end by the dissolving of the Soviet Union in 1991.    </p>
