            This project focuses on how NASA , the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, was perceived and how it can be used as a model for how the United States was 
            imagined as a whole at specific points in time throughout NASA’s history and, NASA’s role on a global scale since its conception in 1958 by President Eisenhower. The 
            cultural atmosphere since the late fifties and early sixties has drastically changed from the time of the Red Scare and the fear of mutually assured destruction to the 
            diametrically opposed times of the present where the main threat people perceive is climate change or overpopulation. NASA, being such a pivotal and active organization 
            publicly competing with the Soviet space agency and behind the scenes helping advance our knowledge of the universe, has been a symbol of America’s technological achievement 
            for decades. Through the process of compiling our own data sets of mission statements, reports, legislation, and timelines from open government information such as from the 
            NASA archives and presidential archives, we found that pairing NASA’s history of progress with the history of the United States allowed us build 3 main eras of NASA’s history.

              There is a lack of commentary to find on the cultural image of NASA throughout time. Although, there is plenty to extrapolate from texts 
              throughout the years about NASA. Most of the controversy surrounding NASA is about funding and what they should be focusing on currently. 
              Much of this idea has not been explored yet, much of the information surrounding NASA is quantitative with not very much qualitative besides 
              more recent twenty first century articles written to criticize NASA, this being more opinion based rather than exploratory. This is a 
              large reasoning for the project to explore the significance of the organization. 
            <br><br>
            What this work aims to accomplish is establishing a view of NASA throughout its lifetime. Our goal is to show that NASA’s plans and focus have mirrored that very 
            much of the United States, you can observe the changes in the times based on what NASA was doing and what their focus was. We are entering another generation where 
            NASA will be a leading figurehead in the future of not only Americans but people globally, therefore observing the past we can learn a lot about our future. NASA helped 
            usher in a new post Cold War age setting the United States as the technological and sole superpower of the world, now we may see them play another pivotal role in the future 
            of all humanity.

          In 1958 the legislation which would see to the creation of NASA was passed through Congress just over a decade after the Cold War began. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
          in the midst of a cold war with the USSR or Soviet Union, created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to keep the Arms Race and the Space Race as separated 
          as possible. The idea at the time was that a military led race to space would only escalate the cold war further.

        <p class="left">The world was carved up at this time is history, either you were supporting the capitalist bulwark of the west or you were 
          supporting the communist east behind the Iron Curtain; very rarely were there countries which did not fall under one side’s influence. The 
          United States was, for the most part, seen as the more technologically advanced of the two superpowers. That was until the Soviet Union successfully 
          launched Sputnik I into space, it was the first artificial satellite and sent shockwaves around the world in the form of communist propaganda proclaiming 
          Soviet superiority after the event. In a previously confidential preliminary report made by the White House on October 16, 1957  the assessment of the situation 
          was that this achievement threatened the political power of the United States. It was deduced that the satellite's success would be seen as proof of the Soviet education 
          and science system which would appeal to those who were in need of greater  technological achievement. It is also stated that Soviet credibility was immensely enhanced due 
          to this scientific feat. Also in 1957, the National Science Board released a statement which urged the need to shift resources and attention to the development of the American 
          education system as well as the furthering of American technology as it was a matter of great importance for the nation’s future. There was a very large niche in the United States
          government which needed to be filled, one which would bolster the furthering of American science. In came NASA onto the battlefield of giants, a battlefield which was fought 
          with unconventional weapons of propaganda and technological ego. And NASA had a very important job at that moment in time, win the space race.

          associated with the development of weapons systems, military operations, or the defense of the United States (including the research and development necessary to make 
          effective provision for the defense of the United States) shall be the responsibility of, and shall be directed by, the Department of Defense”

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: none;"> <u>NASA Enters the Race</u></h4>
        <p class="left">NASA was specifically created to not be military focused as it was stated in the act which wrote NASA into existence. There was, without a doubt, cooperation 
          and coordination between the Department of Defense and NASA since they were both developing rockets at the time, one for missiles and the other for extraterrestrial 
          transportation. This fact about NASA provides insight on the temperament and goals of the United States, they did not want to intensify the Cold War. With tension already at its 
          highest point the last thing anyone wanted was for the Space Race to initiate militarized spacecraft entering orbit or for the Space Race to cause the Cold War to heat up.

        <p class="left">Throughout the first few years of NASA’s work there was a low rate of funding, this is most likely due to the lack of expectation of the lack of foundational 
          work. Then between 1962 and 1964 the budget skyrocketed due to the increased projects and successes of the multiple programs from the Saturn rocket to the Gemini program’s 
          start and the first lunar rover. The increase in funding is an example of America’s increased interest in winning the Space Race, a race which they had a plan to win by 
          achieving what was previously thought to be beyond our limits.

        <p class="left">
            The world was a melting pot for all sorts of propaganda and America was not saved from that, the effects NASA’s progress had on American moral can not be understated. 
            There is no doubt that Sputnik I was a huge hit to take but with the launch of Explorer 1 by the Americans it put the game on a more equal playing field. The next huge 
            milestone was the first man to space, the Soviets were the first to do it but only a few days after NASA sent astronaut Alan Shepard into space for just over nine days 
            in May 1961, NASA caught up to the Soviets in a few days when it took the military three months between Sputnik and Explorer.

        <p class="left">
            This event marked NASA’s impact on the Space 
            Race as undeniable and instrumental to the success. America ended the decade in second place but started the 60’s in a tie with the stakes getting higher and the goals stretching 
            to new heights. May 1961, President John F. Kennedy announces the Apollo Project which plans to put an American man on the Moon due to the urgent needs of the nation. The Gemini 
            missions pave the way for the Apollo missions with the first EVA, or spacewalk, by an American in June 1965 by Edward H. White II. This paired with the monumental landing on the 
            Moon in July 1969 and subsequent moon landings afterwards by American crews launched America into the lead spot of the Space Race. NASA’s creation and involvement shifted the Space 
            Race into the Americans’ favor, NASA was the symbol of American technology and with every achievement the power of the Eastern Bloc faded. Those wanting to learn about the 
            technological might of the United States need look no further than the, then mind bending, goals they had managed to reach.

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: none;"> <u>End of an Era</u></h4>
        
        <p class="left">
            After this American victory in space there was a cooling of heads around the world. The DoomsDay clock moved further from midnight and the collaboration between the Soviet space 
            program and NASA began. The first cooperation was the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in July 1975 which was used to test the compatibility of working in space and the two docking 
            systems which went on to be a success and marked the end of the Space Race with America the victor. It is apparent that NASA’s cooperation with the Soviet space program is the 
            demonstration of lowered tensions which would be a direct translation from America’s view and how those inside and outside could view the state of the nation and the Cold War 
            which would go on to officially be called to an end by the dissolving of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1975 we also saw the lowering in budget to what  would be a transitional 
            period in the history of NASA and subsequently for America as well.

        <p class="left">After the Apollo missions (1961 - 1972) ended, NASA experienced a significant dip in funding from the United States government. A permanent US space
        station was planned starting in 1969 but due to the loss of funding, the project transformed into what we now know as the Skylab project (shown left). <br>
        </p>
        <p class="left"><br>The Skylab project is the United State’s first and last independently built space station and was currently at its height in 1973 to 1974, occupying
        and housing 3 successive crews for a total of 171 days. Unfortunately, the Space Shuttle intended to be used to re-boost Skylab was not prepared 
        in time to save the station. Skylab burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere in 1979 over the Indian Ocean.

        <p class="left">
            Before this, bringing in 1972, Another project was also beginning. President Richard M, Nixon and Soviat Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an 
            agreement on May 24th, 1972. With this agreement, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project began. It marked the first joint mission between the United 
            States and Soviat space flight program and was a resounding symbol of the attempts by both superpowers to lessen the tensions between the two. 
            In July 1975, the two nations watched as 5 men (the american crew shown right) paved the way for future international partnerships by docking two seperate spacecraft. 
            This was the last Apollo mission flown and officially marked the end of the space race between the Soviets and the US, making way for a more 
            cooperative future.

            In this time, Dr. James C Fletcher (seen first left, standing admist the crew of Star Trek's Enterprise) was the director of NASA at the time. Analyzing his speeches lead to a surprising 
            result that we were not expecting. Fletcher was known for his advocacy of the Space Shuttle program throughout his tenure as Directory, worked to 
            complete the Viking Program (a program who's intent was to send landers to mars), oversaw the Skylab mission (as mentioned above), approved the Voyager Space 
            Probes and the Apollo-Soyuz project. He left NASA in 1977 but still was an active advisor to national leaders at the time and played a large role in 
            planning the future of space policy after the Challenger’s last fatal flight. 
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            Knowing this sheds light on how he spoke to Congress about NASA during his time as Director. When analyzing his speeches, we can see that his 
            opinions about NASA’s future was different than those of previous directors. A small sideword; We chose to focus on speeches Directors made to 
            congress on budgets (as the directors are advocating for funds for NASA) and Speeches made directly about NASA’s future and how the Administration 
            was moving forward. Using voyant, we were able to pull the most common words; Space, Program, Nasa, Mars, International, 
            technology, cooperation.

            It’s interesting to see how often Fletcher advocated for NASA to become more cooperative with other nations in 
            his speeches (listed below). Over all, Fletcher advocated for more communication with other superpowers and the programs he ushered and encouraged 
            into existence show it, especially the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Through him, we are better able to see NASA transitioning to a more internationally
            centered entity, taking its first real steps away from the more military driven mission of space expansion in the past.

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: none;"> <u>Dr Robert A. Frosch; 1977-1981</u></h4>
        <p class="left">
            Dr Robert A. Frosch took over as Director of NASA after Fletcher stepped down in 1977, serving in the Carter administration. During his tenure at 
            NASA, he oversaw and implemented Fletcher’s vision of the Space Shuttle program, making it his own. Being a man of science, Dr Frosch was someone 
            who grew NASA in a more research driven approach, allowing for missions, space shuttle slights, technology and data to take precedence. He oversaw 
            several key projects during his tenure at Nasa.

            The first space shuttle orbiter, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/40-years-ago-space-shuttle-enterprise-rolls-to-the-pad">Enterprise (OV101)</a>, 
            named of course after the Enterprise from the popular tv series Star Trek, was first flown on 
            top of a Boeing 747 ferrying aircraft February 17, 1977. The successful flight proved that the Shuttle could fly attached to the 747. While it was 
            never destined for space travel, as it was constructed without engines or functional heat shielding, it marked an important achievement for the NASA 
            community. The Enterprise paved the way for future shuttles to be safer, allowing for NASA to run series of tests on it, including but not limited to 
            Approach and Landing tests (ALT) and the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test (MGVT), so that they could be better able to design future shuttles.
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            Also in 1977 (August 20th, 1977 and September 5th, 1977 to be exact), NASA launched 
            <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/">Voyager 1 and 2</a>, missions that are still continuing to 
            this day. Due to the budget cuts of the time, Voyager 1, which has been initially planned as “Mariner 11”, was scaled back to simply have a flyby
            of both Jupiter and Saturn. However, on November 12th, 1980, Voyager 1 would become the third of five artificial objects to achieve escape velocity 
            required to leave the solar system. Although Voyager 2 was launched before Voyager 1, it took a longer path to Jupiter and Saturn, allowing it to 
            have encounters with both Uranus and Neptune, marking it as the only spacecraft who had visited both of the ice planets.  It later became the fifth 
            artificial object to achieve escape velocity, leaving our solar system after Voyager 1. Both crafts still communicate with NASA and are still 
            collecting data, continuing their voyage of the stars.

        <p class="left">
            And while he wasn’t in office at the time, Dr Frosch also encouraged the 
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/columbia_info.html">Space Shuttle Columbia mission</a> (April 12th, 1981). 
            The heaviest of NASA's orbiters, 
            Columbia weighed too much and lacked the necessary equipment to assist with assembly of the International Space Station. Despite its limitations, the 
            orbiter's legacy is one of groundbreaking scientific research and notable "firsts" in space flight. It marked a notable change in the Space Shuttle program 
            and was useful in teaching many firsts to NASA.

            <a href=”https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/seasat/”>Seasat-A</a> (26 Jun. 1978), one of the earliest Earth-observing satellites desgined to test various 
            oceanographic sensors and gain a better understanding of Earth’s seas. It opperated for a total of 105 days, measuring sea-surface winds and temperatures, 
            wave heights, atmospheric liquid water content, sea ice features and ocean topography before a short circuit in the spacecraft;s electrical system ended the 
            mission.

        <p class="left">
            <a href=”https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/nimbus-7”>Nimbus 7</a> (24 Oct. 1978), research-and-development satellite was launched and served as a stabilized, 
            earth-oriented platform for the testing of advanced systems used to sense and collect data in the pollution, oceanographic, and meteorological disciplines.

            The <a href=”https://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/pvo.html”> Pioneer Venus Orbiter</a> (May 20th, 1978), was a mission whose primary objective was 
            to investigate the solar wind in the Venusian environment, map Venus' surface through a radar imaging system, and study the characteristics of the upper 
            atmosphere and ionosphere. The mission lasted a total of 14 years, the last transmission from the orbiter occuring on October 8th, 1992.

            The <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/solarmax.html">Solar Maximum Mission</a> (Febuary 14th, 1980), was primarily made to study 
            the Sun during the high part of the solar cycle. The mission did hit a snag when the satellite malfunctioned and cut the original mission short. SMM was 
            recovered by the space shuttle Challenger in April of 1984 and serviced while it was in orbit. It lived a productive life until it’s orbit decayed and the 
            SMM burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere in December 1989.

          By looking at the analysis of his speeches, we see that the words space (168), program (119), technology (90), Systems (74), data (73), flight (56), 
          test (46),  appear with the greatest frequency from his selected speeches to congress and those speeches concerning NASA’s future, allowing us to 
          confirm that he was more invested in the research aspect of what NASA had to offer at the time. Dr. Frosch took the lead from Fletcher and built 
          NASA in with research in mind and the future of Space ever present in the space shuttle program, further departing from what NASA had originally 
          been intended to be. Rather than limit themselves  
          He stepped down from NASA as the Presidential Administration changed, going on to conduct further research throughout his lifetime.

      <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: none;"> <u>James M Beggs; 1981-1985</u></h4>
        <p class="left">
            James M Beggs also has a very similar focus on the technology and research aspect of NASA, however he oversaw a large portion of the Space 
            Shuttle program. When analysing his speeches, you can see he had a focus on shuttle, research, development, programs , launch and flight. 
            During Begg’s tenure, the Space Shuttle Columbia experienced its first flight, and in 1982, the space shuttle helped to deploy two commercial 
            communications satellites. The Space Shuttle Challenger also flew in April of 1983, launching three new satellites and the first American woman 
            astronaut, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/sally-ride-first-american-woman-in-space">Dr Sally K Ride</a> 
            made it to space aboard the shuttle. Another groundbreaking achievement occurred the challenger again as in August 1983, 
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/workinginspace/bluford_1st_african_amer.html">Dr Guion S Bluford </a>
            became the first African American astronaut. 
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            In 1984, President Ronald Reagan announced that the United States would be finding 
            and setting out to build a Space Station within a decade. The American people were becoming more and more used to the idea of Space travel and 
            during Begg’s time, 23 missions with the 4 space shuttles, Challenger, Discovery, Colombia, Atlantis, were successfully completed. In this part of 
            NASA’s history, we see a slightly upward trend with the budget even though NASA itself was becoming a more science and technology based entity, which 
            is an interesting shift from the defunding we saw after the completion of the Apollo program. While the budget did not and probably never will achieve 
            the same heights that it did during the cold war, this is still a notable change. The American people also seemed to have shifted their opinions 
            about NASA and what it represented. As the space shuttle program continued, it became a normalized part of American culture, far removed from the 
            military operations it had once been.

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: none;"> <u>Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster</u></h4>
        <p class="left">
            Ronald Regan and NASA held a competition, Teacher in Space, as a means to inspire students, honor teachers and spur an interest in STEM pursuits 
            in 1984. Unfortunately, it was destined not to continue. On January 8th 1986, the 
            <a ref="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_gallery_2437.html">Space Shuttle Challenger</a>was destroyed and its crew of seven-Francis 
            R. (Dick) Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Judith A. Resnik, Ronald E. McNair, Ellison S. Onizuka, Gregory B. Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe-was killed, 
            during its launch from the Kennedy Space Center about 11:40 a.m. The crewmembers of the Challenger represented a cross-section of the American 
            population in terms of race, gender, geography, background, and religion. The explosion became one of the most significant events of the 1980s, 
            as millions around the world saw the accident on television and empathized with any one of the seven crew members killed. William R Graham, the 
            NASA administrator at the time, having served for less than a year, stepped down as Dr James C. Fletcher returned to NASA to once again become 
            NASA’s director. Under his leadership, NASA began implementing the next steps the Agency would take moving forward. The loss of life on the 
            Challenger staggered the American people, but none more so than Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who had been selected to accompany the crew. NASA 
            had had accidents prior to this one but this crash was the first time a civilian had been killed at NASA. Due to this, Fletcher invested heavily in 
            restructuring the organization's management system, making it safer and more efficient. He also oversaw a complete reworking of the shuttle’s 
            components itself. The Space Shuttle Program would continue but only after intensive restructuring.

            At the turn of the millenium NASA had a strong foundation and was poised to make leaps and bounds in research across many fields from new rocket technologies to further 
            understanding of how our universe works. This is the most likely reason why the organization began to see a rise in its budget which no doubt is a feedback loop of  new 
            discoveries by NASA leading to more funding which leads to further discovery. The modern age of NASA is one which has seen the original goals of NASA exemplified to the 
            next degree, it is an age where the plans made are ones which would be pure science fiction to the people of the previous eras if they had not seen the progress.

        <p class="left">
            NASA’s mission statements in this modern era are much more focused on the space part of their name. The beginning of the decade starts with this statement, “To advance 
            and communicate scientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the solar system, and the universe. To advance human exploration, use, and development of space. 
            To research, develop, verify, and transfer advanced aeronautics and space technologies”. This statement is very wide but gives a clear understanding that NASA is here 
            to benefit the studying of Earth and its surrounding space for the betterment of everyone. The phrasing of “advance and communicate” is distinct and gives a feeling of 
            NASA being part of a scientific community that they are sharing their discoveries with. Whether this is a community of Americans, American allies, or a greater global 
            scientific community is unknown from this mission.

        <p class="left">
            Despite this lack of specificity, which is understandable and expected from a general statement, it does show that there is a sense of mass benefit and not just for NASA’s 
            purposes. A shorter, even more general, statement can be found from 2003, “To improve life here, To extend life to there, To find life beyond”. This statement does for sure 
            make itself generalized enough that it says “life” not American lives or even human life but life in its generic form. What the statement implies is a heavier focus on ways 
            NASA can improve life on Earth for all it’s inhabitants and a strengthening of efforts to find extraterrestrial life, at least to some degree. 
        </p>      
        <p class="left">
            There is not a clear mission statement past this until 2011, “Drive advances in science, technology and exploration to enhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic 
            vitality, and stewardship of earth”. In this statement it is clear to see that there is a very strong emphasis on using NASA’s resources and discoveries for the general 
            welfare of humankind and Earth itself. This is also the first time anything such as “stewardship of the Earth” has come up; it can be hypothesized that this is due to a 
            rise in climate change awareness and a movement towards conservation of our planet which we call home. 
        </p>
        <p class="leftLast">
            The final statement is not a mission statement but what they call a vision statement, “To discover and expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity”. It is similar to the 2003 
            statement in the fact that both are short, but this more recent one makes one distinct separation from almost every other mission or vision statement, it addresses humanity 
            directly. This is important to note because only recently do NASA statements include the benefit of mankind, of course they have made monumental achievements such as the 
            first person on the moon which was a “one giant leap for mankind”. The significance stems from the fact that NASA is an American federal agency, one which is focused on 
            space and aeronautical research, yet with their resources and technology there is a way for their work to benefit humanity in many ways. It should be known that of course 
            the United States is still the number one priority just by principal.

        <!--(Add Opportunity and Spirit Picure, Its labled opportunity and Curiosity but ts actually spirit)-->
        <p class="left">
            The first decade of the 2000’s was one of great planning and imagination. NASA’s campus received an overhaul, facilities were removed and the Mission Integration Center was 
            added onto the grounds. In 2003 the second and third Mars Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity were launched and landed in 2004 with the intent of finding water on Mars. These 
            rovers lasted well past their lifetime with Opportunity or Oppy only fading out in 2018 ,during a super massive dust storm on the red planet, when it was only supposed to 
            last 3 months.

        </p>
        <p class="left">
            The Constellation Program was created by the Bush administration to encourage and set deadlines for many achievements in space such as putting boots back on the moon by 2020, 
            creating more powerful rockets, and better landers for prolonged stays on the moon. Many ideas have been scrapped, pushed back or altered greatly like the plan to put people 
            back on the moon in 2020 which was over budget and behind schedule.

            Plans, such as completing the ISS, were still carried out following the solar installation being delivered in early 2000. As of March 2020 it is clear that the plans were 
            rather ambitious and many plans have been pushed into the near or far future. One reason for this could be lack of funding by the United States government, compared to the 
            first era “Golden Age” of NASA there is a lack of funding appropriated in the modern era. Even with some slight decreases in funding the general trend has been a steady climb 
            up. In the second decade of the 2000s the Space Shuttle Program was shut down, the last shuttle flight was granted in 2011.

            The 2010s saw many probes being sent out into the solar system and many discoveries such as two moons around Pluto. Multiple probes were sent to visit comets and planets 
            such as the Messenger spacecraft which was sent to Mercury in 2004 but ended its mission in 2015. The Juno spacecraft arrived at Jupiter in July 2016 and observed the largest 
            planet in our solar system. In 2012 SpaceX entered the mix, a private spacecraft and launching company which docked it’s Dragon craft with the ISS. The Space Launch System, 
            or SLS begins development at NASA which is meant to be the most powerful vehicle made by NASA to deliver people and supplies into space

        <p class="leftLast">
            The Curiosity Rover landed on Mars in 2012 as well, this over $2 billion project is still functional and plans to be indefinitely, it may even be there to greet the first 
            humans on Mars. There were also talks if the ISS would be operational or “profitable” after 2020, NASA and Russia are both still interested in it but there is skepticism 
            among the other partnering nations.

            No longer are the reaches of space only accessible to those governments which are superpowers on the world scale. In the modern age there are multiple private contracting 
            companies which are, in some cases, leading in spaceflight efficiency. The top 8 most notable civilian spaceflight organizations are Orion Span, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, 
            Space Adventures, Roscosmos, KosmoKurs, Axiom Space, and the company which is making big waves, SpaceX . A company led by billionaire tech founder Elon Musk which is pioneering 
            many new technologies such as reusable rockets and cheaper launch costs. 
          
        </p>
        
        <p class="left">
            These factors have led to many launches being contracted out to the company by NASA because doing so is cheaper than doing it themselves. SpaceX have cut the prices of launches 
            to at least a 10th of their former cost and that is said to only be a start. This whole situation makes sense as it follows the progression America has gone through many times, 
            the United States government contracts companies to make aircraft, naval ships, and arms for its military and nonmilitary needs; it seems logical that space flight would take 
            the same path. The plans SpaceX have far surpass the current capabilities NASA has for launch capacity but NASA has a larger foundation which helps SpaceX with having a place 
            to really test and use their rockets, examples are deliveries to the ISS and other supplies into space. This relationship helps NASA do its job cheaper and not be blocked by 
            government restrictions or budget allocation while SpaceX gets to help accelerate the mission to space exponentially. 
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            There is currently no consensus on what this means for everything politically besides help expedite the roadmap to space. Currently SpaceX has its sights set on Mars with its 
            “Big Falcon Rocket” and “Starship” reaching the red planet with cargo missions in 2022 and then crewed flights following later. NASA seems to be behind in their development 
            in their heavy rocket system the SLS or Space Launch System.

        <p class="left">
            Jim Bridenstine is the current NASA Administrator, he is also the first elected official to be Administrator at NASA. Nominated by President Donald Trump in September 2017 and 
            confirmed by the Senate in April 2018 Bridenstine is a former member of Senate where he was a member of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. While he was a climate 
            change denier in the past he has since changed his tone and is now an advocator for the fact that climate change is in fact real. Bridenstine has also been an advocate for the 
            need of a moon base and an acceleration of the SLS project due to the logistical problems of using other heavy rocket types like those made by SpaceX. Despite those problems 
            there has been a strong working relationship between the CEO of SpaceX, Elon Musk, and Bridenstine. All in all, the current NASA Administrator seems committed to the current 
            vision “To discover and expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity”.

        <p class="left">
            The question which rides at the center of all this is what this means for America in the modern age and how is it related? It can be concluded that the United States is well 
            ahead the rest of the world with technology whether it be military, spaceflight or other technology (there are a few places where there are isolated or few cases of programs 
            which surpass those of the US or are on par but over all the dominance is clear). 
        </p>
        <p class="leftLast">
            NASA is working with and trying to keep partnerships in space going because those are some of the most diverse bonds seen in the world and they are the only ones of their 
            kind, more specifically the International Space Station which bonds the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada. The United States has a large role to play as a 
            unifier as NASA does in the context of space, the ownership of land here on Earth may be easy to determine but who owns areas in space? When we become an interplanetary 
            species what becomes of our Earthbound allegiance? With America or American companies leading the movement into space, space outposts and colonies there will be much to 
            consider about who and what we are as a species and culture.
