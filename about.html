            <p class="text-white mb-4"> 
                Our data was rather expansive and not very organized to say the least. We started with an idea and as it grew into what it is now we had to include 
                more and more data sets to be able to provide the right context and right information. The mission statements are not enough data to completely base
                 a large project on, so with this in mind we had to find other ways to incorporate data and so we used budget information, text analysis of directors 
                 speeches and a timeline to go along with the mission statements in order to make the project relevant. Due to this use of so many data sets the data 
                 is rather unorganized but still worked to give us a good final product. 

            </p>     
            <p class="text-white mb-4">      
                We had to leave out many NASA missions because there are so many to name that we had to just focus on the ones we saw as most monumental or remarkable. 
                We also did not focus on much of the in-atmosphere work NASA did and chose to focus more on the space work because it was more interesting and made the 
                most changes on a global scale. That said I will not deny the importance of supersonic air travel, from my research it seems that most of those flight 
                achievements are more often awarded to the Airforce which is not our focus. Things we also left out would include some speeches and various statements 
                made by each director as there are too many to go through without taking days to go through each and everyone of the thousands of speeches, interviews 
                and statements. 

            </p>
            <p class="text-white mb-4">
                    We tried to include all of the available mission statements as that was our connecting focus as well as as much historical context as possible. 
                    I believe that the information given in this project is a rather comprehensive history of both the United States in some ways and definitely of 
                    NASA. That's not to say there is not room for much improvement in the composition of our data.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">About Us</h2>
            <p class="text-white mb-4">
                    We are Aidan Pintuff and Gabrielle Cervantes. Both of us are students at Western Washington University and we did this project for a computer 
                    science class as a passion project. When it came time to plan our project we both knew we wanted to do something in space, we both have a fascination 
                    with NASA and so we decided to start there. Eventually we solidified our ideas and this is the product. There is a good chance that this website will 
                    be updated beyond this point and I believe that is because we want to do NASA and its history justice.
